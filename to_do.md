goals for November 17

identify location and status of first 100000 posts
turn into json if needed
parse if needed

-----

Getting close to having a large enough collection of posts that I can run
make_df on an EC2 and start looking at plots

This means I should scp everything in my trend analysis folder over to that ec2
