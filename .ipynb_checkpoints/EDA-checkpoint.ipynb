       "[' Welcome to Chictopia! A community where people help each other answer questions on how to dress well and shop smart. My blog will mainly cover big events happening here at Chictopia. Ill start with introducing our team. This is a photo of our CEO, Helen. Shes our resident fashion maven, and the brain that came up with this brilliant idea. With the current fashion trends so media driven, she hopes to create a fashion democracy where people with original style can prevail, without the backing of big advertising houses. Shes one of the few people who can talk the talk with both engineers and sales people. This is her in action at our first company event, Capture Spring, the photo shoot for our power users. You can learn more about her style at her blog, decorating the street. ',\n",

       " ' As most of you know, Chictopia had our photo shoot, Capture Spring, in February for our power users. We had a team of four photographers and fifty local fashionistas. Pretty cool huh? The idea is to dress real people rather than professional models. After all, clothes are worn by real people, for the most part. Wed like to start a movement for designers, stores, and major fashion houses to stop marketing us ugly clothes on gorgeous models. Its misleading, and just plain vain. Come on, how many of us still fall for it? A garbage bag can look good on Heidi Klum, with a belt of course. But what about the rest of us? The ones with short legs and small boobs? What looks good on us? Chictopia hopes to answer these questions by connecting like minded and like shaped users. This way we can discuss and arrive at the solutions ourselves, instead of relying on photos of Heidi Klum. ',\n",
       " ' Yes, tights are in. The best thing is that tights are perfect for San Francisco weather, especially in the summer. For those of us fortunate enough to live in the city with the coldest summers, we all know the feeling of stepping outside in a mini skirt and feeling wind chill through our legs in July.  So here is the solution, a pair of black tights, all year round. ',\n",
       " ' I have two pieces of accessories that I love: my scarf and my big purse. A scarf can make any outfit look interesting. A black and white scarf goes with almost any color. My big purse was a purchase I made in Japan. Its soft leather makes it not so bulky, but when in need, it can fit an entire coat inside it. Perfect for a long walk around the city. ',\n",
       " ' We had the pleasure of working with Jules, the owner of Zolita,  a Mission boutique who was supportive and generous enough to lend us clothes for the photo shoot. This top was on loan to us but Lili loved it so much that she decided to purchase it. Its stretchy and flatters most womens body. Well, yes, Lili does have a better body than most people. ',\n",
       " ' I love the clean lines of her outfit. Her white jacket complements her dark jeans very well. ',\n",
       " ' Wed like to take this opportunity to thank all our private beta users for taking the time to give us valuable feedback on our site. Every week, we push out some changes to make our site better. This week, we made a few changes: 1. Boutique page is now up and running! Weve got a handful of local boutiques participating and the number is growing. We are very excited to have their photos on the site, making it easy for users to get inspiration on how to dress and click to buy! 2.

       " ' Janeens look was a hit at the photo shoot. She made quite an entrance. Courtesy of Density boutique, a new hip urban clothing store in the Mission. Angelita, the buyer, has a great eye for unique looks that fit San Franciscans taste. She acquired some good customers at the photo shoot. ',\n",

       " ' What she has on flatters her curve very well. If you break down her pieces individually, they are all very basic. The blue dress shirt, the thick belt, and the plain black boots. But together they make an interesting outfit. Well done. ',\n",
       " ' Does owning thirty purses qualify as having a purse obsession? Im not sure. But the down side of having so many purses is that not all of them get the attention they deserve. Take my strawberry purse for example, Ive had her in my closet for a year, and Ive only carried her out once or twice. Today is a light day on business meetings for me, so Im taking her out for a walk. Destination  the container store. Need to get a bigger filing cabinet for our company papers. ',\n",
       " ' I like a girl with a simple top and a pair of nice jeans. She does it well. The layering is a good idea, otherwise the white top would seem too low cut on her curvy body. Slimming jeans with sharp black heels will never go out of style. ',\n",

Its a cashmere wool blend, very forgiving on small bumps. Xtine asked about legging last time, so Im showing her a new way to wear leggings. Short pants are fun to wear in the summer, but most corporate girls shy away from it because it falls above the knee. A pair of black leggings is perfect for this. And below are some places you can find them. Bluefly $39 Pink lace $6 ',\n",
       " ' Im not sure if shes wearing boots or not, but I like the way the tips of her shoes peek out from the bottom of her jeans. The lighter shade of the jeans goes well with her brown shoes. ',\n",
       " ' Some people dont like the term hippie goth, but I think its flattering. It means that the girl has femininity and naughtiness. This is a very San Franciscan look  thumbs up. ',\n",
       " ' This is the last of our photo shoot series. I found this photo relevant for the moment, as Chictopia is getting ready for another big event  our last release in March. We hope to be pushing out quite a few new changes in the next day or two. Watch out! ',\n",
       " ' What are you wearing now? Who are the people around you that inspire you to dress well? You know, the girl at the office who always has interesting shoes and cool accessories? What if she left the company and now your office is left with geeky engineers wearing plain gray T-shirts and baggy jeans everyday? Yes, I know, geeky nerds are smart and make interesting conversation. But what about the visuals  who appeases your eyes? For those of us here at Chictopia, Lulu has been the girl that spices up our work day with her dramatic and edgy outfits. Her outfits are like art on the wall. Now that shes on vacation in China, our what are you wearing now feature can help us get an update on what shes wearing  even if it is just textual descriptions. For all Chictopians, this feature is a good way to 1) Express your style verbally, without having to get up and get in front of a camera.   2) Find out what people are wearing in the Bay Area, so you can keep up with seasonal trends without having to walk around town.  3) Discover interesting and well dressed people around Chictopia.

Well reader this is an unassuming pair of Levis 521 jeans. For me, these fit better than my $180+ 7s, Citizens and Loomstates. Style isnt about brands, but certainly we have seen in recent years a bump in brands on our butts, cheekily displaying an emblem in rhinestones or a rainbow hued logo stitching, all silently whispering a triple digit price tag.

Im not against seeing some stylish layering with opaque tops. However, it does get pretty blase when its another lame white-on-black or vice versa pairing. That kind of couple comes off more as accidental than premeditated. (But, of course, if your thing is all about looking accidental, then well just have to agree to disagree. :)) For the sake of taking advantage of layering and spicing up outfits, however, I am all about surprising passersby with eye-popping color. I picked out this bra from Betsey Johnson because I love fuchsia, and I love all the unobnoxious details that go into the bra (for when youre without that sheer top). Normally I find Betsey Johnson pretty annoying  Dont get me wrong, I love her party dresses, but any combination of leopard print plus pink piping plus emblazoned logos that rhyme with Wetseyville is not appealing to me. I should also note that Im a 36A, and when I tried this on in 36A I didnt like how it gave me ugly side boob.

The high-waist is polarizing because there arent too many of us that look flat out amazing in high-waisted jeans. Its a difficult trend to wear well. Even when it does work, instead of Wow you look incredible! its more like Wow, you can actually pull that off! Yet we persist, determined to wiggle our way into fits that seem reserved for the select few with the agency-esq proportions. Will this trend ever become more inclusive? With the resurgence of the trouser fit, the answer is yes. Youll do more than just pull off the look, youll look like a star. With wider legs, tamed flare and over-the-shoe openings, high-waisted trouser jeans still arent for everyone, but they definitely invite more of us to the party. Disco fabulous, sassy and buoyant, the high-waisted trouser jean is more forgiving than its tapered indie counterparts. These will never be mistaken for the bum flattening abominations that some moms made famous. This is a fit that actually flatters your curves! If the first adaptations of this 70s inspired look discouraged you, dont turn your back on this version. Give the high-waisted trouser jean a try. Our verdict: hot, hot, hot! ',\n",

Obviously the uniform was not nearly funky, fresh and quirky as Anna Suis collection. Here# is the runway video to the AS 08 Spring collection. I got this black silk bowtie dress/jumper from a vintage store in San Francisco. I love how the shoulder area is sheer and its got poufy sleeves, POUFY >_<. very femme. Perfect for dinner parties and such. i usuallly dont like to accessorize as much cos the bowtie already makes a statement in itself. my o how much i love my red-soled heel pumps goes really well with this dress.

AHHH! ive really hated living in the dorms for another year but thats another story. all i care about is the extra closet space!! at the moment i cant find anywhere to put my all of my clothes and its really piling up :( i wonder if the other contenders feel the same way i do about this place. this group of three freshmen sounded really confident about getting it (although we were referred by the current tenants) and were talking about where theyre going to put their stuff while we were already thinking of the other mediocre places were going to visit. well, well find out tomorrow or monday, i guess. i wish i could have taken pictures but i really didnt want to get my hopes up even more. 50/50 chance? okay, well see :( anyway, sorry for the rant. it just kind of came to me. expect my contribution to coed ugly sometime tomorrow!!

       " ' Recently, quite a few people have asked Helen how she came up with the idea for Chictopia. Here is her story. Helen has been around three web companies and knew that she had a talent for understanding user experience and building great websites. Two of the websites she managed have been nominated for the Webby award, the Oscar of website design and navigation. Its always been her dream to make a website on her own. Last October, Helen came across this old issue of Time magazine, lying around the corner of her night stand. It was the issue that named You as the person of the year. The story basically centered around the new digital age, where you, the individual, can change and shape the world by putting your music talent on Myspace, or your film production talent on YouTube. It got her thinking about other talents out there that havent been explored. The answer she came to was fashion. Like film and music, the fashion industry has traditionally been dictated by major brands, whether high end or mass produced, the inspiration of what we wear is mainly comes fashion magazines or television commercials. The images professionally shot, models hand-picked, personas elaborately fabricated. Basically, we are all dressing the way Banana Republic and J Crews design team envisioned. But what about you? The individual who has the talent to be on the design team for Prada but has not yet been discovered. The person who sets trends and creates new styles among your community? Why isnt there a portal for fashion icons to be discovered? After all, like film and music, fashion is another form of expression, based on individuality. So Helen got out her laptop and started drawing using Microsoft Paint. The wire frames of a website that would ultimately become the new fashion destination. Chictopia, style created for the people, by the people. To the left is a group of girls that she sees as style-icons-to-be.  Some have already been featured by well known websites like Teen Vogue, or Whowhatweardaily, some are still to be discovered. But one thing is for sure. They are all influential; not just within the walls of Chictopia, but amongst their own community, and the ever expanding circle of people who appreciate individual style and authenticity.
